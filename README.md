Purple &amp; SOC Labs | My cybersecurity learning journey

update: adding description

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity learning lab!  
Here I document everything I practice while learning **Blue Team, Purple Team, and SOC analysis** — from Linux command fundamentals to real-world incident detection.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a solid foundation in **Blue & Purple Team** techniques.  
- Develop **real-world SOC reflexes** (triage, log analysis, detection engineering).  
- Learn how to simulate attacks ethically and detect them efficiently.  
- Share my progress publicly as proof of learning and motivation.
