# Linux Fundamentals #2 Tryhackme

In part 2, we'll be ditching the in-browser functionality and help you get started in what is a fundamental skill in being able to login to and control the terminals of remote machines. Not only this, but the room will also have you:

Unlocking the potential of your first few commands by introducing you to using flags and arguments
Advancing your knowledge of the filesystem to perform some more useful commands such as copying and moving files
Discovering how access to files and folders is managed and how we can determine our access.

Running your first few scripts and executables!

## How to login in a Linux remote machine

ssh = Secure shell
Allow us to execute commands on another device remotely
The data sent is encrypted

Exemple of connection: ss "User@ipdestino"
Then it ask for the password, once we put it it is done, we can execute commands in the remote computer/servercd

If i type a command + --help i will have all the commands for it

## Copy, create, delete and move files

Touch or mkdir to create folders and files

rm = remove files and folders
rm - r "foldername" 

Copying and Moving Files and Folders (cp, mv)

Copying and moving files is an important functionality on a Linux machine. Starting with cp, this command takes two arguments:

1. the name of the existing file

2. the name we wish to assign to the new file when copying

CP = To copy files and the content of the files
MV = To rename a folder or a document

Exemple
```
tryhackme@linux2:~$ mv note2 note3
tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls           
folder1 note note3
```
