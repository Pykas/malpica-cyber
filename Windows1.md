# Windows

This course reminds me how to use Windows in a more administrative ways

We go throught the user names, how to use the OS in a more admin point of viwe
Permissions, remote control, accounts, etc

To view accounts we con go through run and text lusrmgr.msc, is the most efficient way to see the acocunts, their groups and descriptions, also to modify them
Use Wireshark to improve the managing of the account in the computer and more security

Task manager can be accesed by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+ESC
